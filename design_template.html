Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

            <h2>Proximity &mdash; <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for proximity --></h2>
            <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">
            <p>
                <!-- Replace this comment with the web site name shown in the image -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how proximity is being used in the image. -->
            </p>

            <h2>Alignment &mdash; Wyatt Larson</h2>
            <img src="Dji.GIF" width="270" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
            <p>
                <b><i>Dji.com</i></b>
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:times new roman;">
                Dji.com did a very good job at making sure their website was properly aligned<br> (though they had a missing picture for their newest drone, the Mavic Pro).<br> They used a tile or block look to their webstore, each block featuring a unique <br>item or product group. They aligned it in a way that the banner on top dominates<br> the screen, then the smaller blocks underneath for additional information on<br> products. Everything is straight and uniform. The dji logo is in center alignment<br> of the page. All in all, they have a very properly and classically aligned website.

            <h2>Repetition &mdash; <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for repetition --></h2>
            <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
            <p>
                <!-- Replace this comment with the web site name shown in the image -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how repetition is being used in the image. -->
            </p>

            <h2>Contrast &mdash; Jossten Childs --></h2>
            <img src="apple.gif" width=270 alt="">
            <p>
                <b><i>Apple.com</i></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                I beleive that this website is an excellent example of how contrast con draw the<br> attention to the shape of a product. Apple products have commonsly been known<br> for their excellent form factor, and Apple's website plays on this by showing<br> outlines around all the phones and watches, effectively making them "pop."<br> I also think that the use of black text on a white background is an example of<br> intelligent design. This process darws the eye to the center of the iamge where<br> the text is, and effectively makes the text seem bigger and "more important"
            </p>

            <h2>Typography &mdash; Nicole Bunch</h2>
            <img src="Amazon.GIF" width="270" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
            <p>
                <b><i>Amazon.com</i></b>
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:times new roman;">

                This is a good example of Typography because there is consistency in the sans-serif fonts <br>but contrast is also created between different sizes and variation on bold and regular typeface.
