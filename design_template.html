			<h1>Design Principles in Mobile Sites</h1>
			<!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs four items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

                Dji.com did a very good job at making sure thier website was properly aligned (though they had a missing picture for their newest drone, the Mavic Pro). They used a tile or block look to their webstore, each block featuring a unique item or product group. They aligned it in a way that the banner on top dominates the screen, then the smaller blocks underneath for additional information on products. Everything is straight and uniform. The dji logo is in center alignment of the page. All in all they have a very properly and classically aligned website.
