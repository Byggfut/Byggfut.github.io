            <h2>Proximity &mdash; Kaio Doxey</h2>
            <img src="Etsy.GIF" width=547 alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">
            <p>
                <b><i>Esty.com</i></b>
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is called Etsy. It is primarily a merchandising website that sells vintage or hand-made goods. I thought that this was a good example of proximity because it allows you to simply search through the goods of the<br> website by not just having a search bar, but also having search options. If you don’t know exactly what it is you want, the search options are all grouped close together to help you make a selection. Obviously this shows that the search options are connected, due to their proximity. This makes selling Etsy’s merchandise easier because you can navigate through to find something specific, or just browse through a category that you find interesting. Another good thing about the proximity of this page is that it separates itself from unrelated places of the web page. For example, the logo, shopping cart, and sign-in buttons are all separated from the search section by a picture of merchandise. Overall, the proximity layout of this page makes it really easy to use.

            <h2>Alignment &mdash; Wyatt Larson</h2>
            <img src="Dji.GIF" width="270" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
            <p>
                <b><i>Dji.com</i></b>
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:times new roman;">
                Dji.com did a very good job at making sure their website was properly aligned (though they had a missing picture for their newest drone, the Mavic Pro). They used a tile or block look to their webstore, each block featuring a unique item or product group. They aligned it in a way that the banner on top dominates the screen, then the smaller blocks underneath for additional information on products. Everything is straight and uniform. The dji logo is in center alignment of the page. All in all, they have a very properly and classically aligned website.

            <h2>Repetition &mdash; <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for repetition --></h2>
            <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
            <p>
                <!-- Replace this comment with the web site name shown in the image -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how repetition is being used in the image. -->
            </p>

            <h2>Contrast &mdash; Jossten Childs</h2>
            <img src="apple.gif" width=270 alt="">
            <p>
                <b><i>Apple.com</i></b>
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:times new roman;">
                I beleive that this website is an excellent example of how contrast con draw the attention to the shape of a product. Apple products have commonsly been known for their excellent form factor, and Apple's website plays on this by showing outlines around all the phones and watches, effectively making them "pop." I also think that the use of black text on a white background is an example of intelligent design. This process darws the eye to the center of the iamge where the text is, and effectively makes the text seem bigger and "more important"
            </p>

            <h2>Typography &mdash; Nicole Bunch</h2>
            <img src="Amazon.GIF" width="270" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
            <p>
                <b><i>Amazon.com</i></b>
            </p>
            <p style="font-family:times new roman;">

                This is a good example of Typography because there is consistency in the sans-serif fonts <br>but contrast is also created between different sizes and variation on bold and regular typeface.
