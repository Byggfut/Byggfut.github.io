            <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
            <p>My website, pickupandplay.com will deliver content that will help budding guitarists “pick up” and start playing guitar. Thus, the material will focus on and cater to someone playing guitar for the first time. </p>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>My target demographic will be those who are not only learning how to play guitar for the first time, but also those who are playing an instrument for the first time. This will mean that I will have to refrain from using musical jargon, and when it is absolutely necessary to use this jargon I will have to explain it so that the user can understand. My age demographic will likely skew more towards a younger audience, likely those under 30 years old. This means that I must use a user interface that mirrors the programs   that younger people already use on their smartphones and tablets, as this lower age demographic will also most likely access my website through their smartphones or possibly their tablets. This means that I will need to make sure that I base all my designs I in a way so that they appear in a pleasing when viewed on a smartphone or tablet. I don’t imagine that many people will be accessing my website using a desktop interface, so I will allocate most of my efforts towards building a pleasing mobile experience. My audience will, for the time being, be based towards English speakers, so I will only be offering the site in a English format.
                <h3>Organization</h3>
                <p>Since my target audience will be those who are complete beginners to playing guitar, it will be important to organize my content by skill required. For instance, I will want to make sure that the lessons are divided into categories by difficulty, so that the lessons that are easiest (or most vital for beginners to know and learn) appear closest to the top of the. In addition, the content that relates to learning songs will be placed on a separate page from the content that relates to musical theory, as that content would not be as appealing to those who are learning guitar for the first time. To specifically cater to the crowd who are learning guitar for the first time, one of the tabs on my website will by specifically for those who are learning guitar for the first time. It will contain information on the physical requirements for playing guitar, as well as some of the first steps that need to be taken before starting to play guitar. I will also include the first video lesson that explains the basics of guitar, and provide information on how to play your first song.
                <h3>UI Elements and "Mobile First"</h3>
                    <p>As said earlier, the website will utilize UI elements that are prevalent in apps as well as mobile applications. This will include a drop-down navigation bar, as well as clearly differentiated and segmented sections. This is all to create a more streamlined and pleasing experience for the average user.
                To facilitate those in a mobile environment, I will use a “mobile first” mentality when developing the web site. What this means in terms of mobile usability is that, firstly, all my text will be of proper size to viewed on a smaller screen. I will also attempt to create a links and other interactive sections large enough with the intent of making touch navigation on smaller screens both possible and feasible.
            <h2>JSON Implementation</h2>
            <p>I plan using JSON in two specific spots in my website. I plan on using the JSON to push data to my blog page. This data will include date, subject, and information relating to some type of lesson or conecept I plan to post. I also plan to use JSON data to push videos to my "learning songs" page, allowing me to be able to cenrtralize future video uploads to this one location, without having to edit the HTML.
