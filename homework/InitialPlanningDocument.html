                <h1>Purpose Statement</h1>
                    <p>The central purpose of this site is to provide the user with adequate information regarding the weather in one of three principal cities. It will display various weather related attributes, including temperature (both daily high and low and hourly reports), wind speed, wind direction in miles per hour, precipitation level in inches, as well as an overall summary of weather conditions for the day. The information will be presented in a way that is clear and easy to understand, so that it can be accessible to a wide audience. The content in the website is shown in a manner that is appealing to the user, including the use of graphics and well formatted text. The audience that this web site is intended for those who live in or are visiting one of the three included cities.<br><br>
                    This website will establish clarity and fluidity in several ways. The use of graphics with each section will help provide both clarity and a positive user experience. For example, the current weather summary section will have a corresponding graphic that explains the conditions listed.  The website will also feature segregated sections to aid in clarity. Each of the areas that describes a particular attribute will be separated in a way that would make them easy to distinguish, thus making the wanted information easier to find.

                </p>
                <h1>Target Audience Description</h1>
                <h2><i>Who is my Website for?</i></h2>
                    <p>The demographic of those visiting my site will likely be very broad. The only constant among those visiting my site will likely be my geographic location. I imagine that all those who use my site will likely be either living in or visiting one of the cities featured on my website. Considering that my website’s demographic will likely be very large, I will likely want to plan my website around the lowest common denominator in regard to comfort with technology. This will mean that I will want to try to develop content and a layout for my website that will be easily interpreted by those with at least a basic knowledge of technology and a basic education. Considering that my content will be applicable to a wide age demographic, it will also be penitent that I develop content that is not offensive or confusing to older users, and yet still interesting to younger visitors. Also considering that weather is a factor that affects a community indiscriminately, it is very likely that income will not be a very important factor when determining the function of this website. That being said, since mobile phones might be the most widely accessible and least expensive form of accessing this website, an emphasis on the mobile version should definitely be taken.  </p>
                <h2><i>How Will the Website Meet the Needs of the Visitor?</i></h2>
                    <p>Considering that my site will contain a large amount of data, it will be important that I abide by the rules outlined in the article “Less is More.” One of the principles that I believe will be most fundamental is the use of whitespace. Considering the large amount of data that will be displayed in my content, it will be critical that I make sure to space the various sections I will be creating out so that I don’t overwhelm my users upon entering the website. Hierarchy will also be a critical concern when developing my website. If the user cannot find the information he or she wants quickly after reaching my website, they will most likely click away to another weather website. Thus, placing emphasis on key data such as temperature and overall weather conditions will take precedent over other less vital pieces of data. Finally, involving the concept of unity will also be critical, as it will help me combine the seemingly unrelated pieces of weather data into a harmonious structure.
                    </p>
                <h2><i>How Will the Web Site Be Organized?</i></h2>
                    <p>As stated in the previous section, the website will rely heavily on the principles of hierarchy as well as Fitt’s law in order for the information to be presented in a way that is easily located. The most important information will be presented in the top left hand corner, and then will continue down the left hand side leading to a large and difficult to miss button which will lead to the next page.
                <h2><i>How Will the Website Be Enjoyable to Use?</i></h2>
                    <p>In my experience, one the primary factors that improves the user experience with a website is the intelligent use of visuals. During my research of various existing weather websites and applications, I found that the most appealing ones generally had high resolution and often dynamic representations of the current weather conditions. This not only makes the website more usable, but also appear more polished and professional.<br><br>
                    Another way that the website will be enjoyable is through the use of easily legible fonts. During my research of various websites, I noticed that many of the least appealing ones also had some of the least appealing font choices. This led to decreased clarity, and ultimately led to me clicking away from the website. If I want to retain users and keep them returning to my website, I will need to make intelligent decisions regarding font choice.

                <h2><i>How Will the Website Accommodate Those Using a Mobile Device?</i></h2>
                    <p>As I stated earlier, mobile users will most likely constitute the majority of the traffic for my website. Thus, making accommodations for mobile users will be paramount. One of the most frustrating aspects for many users is a very small margin of error for hitting buttons on a website. Thus, it will be critical that my website contain buttons that are appropriately sized and easy to tap, particularly the buttons for navigating between the various displayed cities. It will also be critical (especially for those using a smaller screened mobile phone) to limit the amount of content that is displayed at any given time on a webpage. An overload of information of information (particularly if a smaller font is used) can lead to an excessive need for zooming. This level of micromanagement can be both obtrusive and limiting for mobile users.

            <h3>Why was this particular persona chosen?</h3>
            <p>As stated in my audience page, the audience of my website will likely be very widespread, ranging from the very old to the very young. I decided to choose an older individual who might by less acquainted with technology primarily because if a website can be used by an older individual who is less experienced with technology, it will consequently be even simpler to younger users who are more familiar with modern web design. </p>
