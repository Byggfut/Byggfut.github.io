            <h2>What Does the Word "semantic" actually mean?</h2>
            <p>According to dictionary.com it is "of, relating to, or arising from the different meanings of words or symbols"</p>
            <h2>What are the Semantic Structures of HTML5?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML semantic structures are fundamental to HTML code</li>
                <li>The word "semantic elements" quite literally means "elements with a meaning"</li>
                <li>"Non-semantic" elements such as the div and span don't tell anything about content </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Headers: The Headlines</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Like the headline of a newspaper, header identifies the theme of the content</li>
                <li>According to th ebook "HTML and CSS3 for the Real World" a header is "a group of introductory or navigational aids.</li>
                <li>They are often used as ways of introducing the content</li>
                <li>Headings are designated with the elements h1 to h6. The smaller the element, the larger the heading.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Nav: the Index</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Like the index of a newspaper, the nav section of a website guides the user where to go</li>
                <li>Often used to house various links to other portions of the website</li>
                <li>Navigation portions are designated by the "nav" tag</li>

            <h2>Section: The Hard News</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Represents a generic section of a document or application</li>
                <li>Can be compared to the "hard news" or the most up to date information that requires background</li>
                <li>Examples include terms of service, "about" or mission statement sections, or specific blog entries or news stories</li>
                <li>Essentially, anywhere there are long blocks of text</li>
                <li>Must be semantic of meaningful to the overall theme of the website</li>
                <li>Identified by the tag "section"</li>

                <h3>How the Section Element Appears in the Web Page</h3>
                <img src="/images/sectionimage.gif" width=900 alt="Demo">
            <h2>Article</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Very imilar to the section tag</li>
                <li>The only difference is that section is thematically related to the rest of the page</li>
                <li>Article can be thematically completely seperate from the rest of the page</li>
                <li>Like the feature story in a newspaper, it goes into depth and incldues background regarding the news story</li>
                <li>A good rule of thumb when deciding whether or not to use an article or section is to consider a question. Could it be published independently without modification?</li>
                <li>An artcile is identified by the tag "article"</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Aside: Editorial Columns</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Represents a part that's "tangentially related to the conetnt aroyhnd the aise element,  and which could be conisdered seperate form that content</li>
                <li>They could be compared to editorial columns</li>
                <li>While editoral columns are still part of the newspaper, they tend to share seperate ideas and opinions from the main articles</li>
                <li>Nav tags can be used for sidebars and other small bits of information that while related to the content, are still different enough to necessitate seperation.
                </li>
                </ul>
