            <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
                <p>To those who are grading my website, I wanted to make sure that I clarified regarding some devaitaions from my original design. As seen in the above picture, I had considerably more space in the left-hand margin of my website. While I initially started my design this way, it quickly became apparent that the would either have to be comporessed or very difficult to read. Instead, I made the executive decsion to shrink the right-hand margin and implement a more scrolling-friendly design.
                </p>
                <p>To clarify regarding the changing of my navigation bar style, I quickly realized that (1) the bar would be too small if designed like I had in the diagram, and (2) having a fixed bar at the bottom would be both difficult to press, and require the user to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page. Thus, I figured that a fixed bar would make for a more pleasant user experience.</p>
                <p>However, I have tried to remain faithful to my original design in other aspects, and I hope that this is is evident as it is being reviewed.</p>
