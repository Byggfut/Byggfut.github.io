            <h2>Best Site: Apple</h2>

            <p>URL:
                <a href="http://www.apple.com/">www.apple.com</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Images:</h3>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
                <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <h3>What is the Demographic for this Website?</h3>
                    <p>The target demographic is probably adults between the ages of 25-45 years old. These indviduals likely have above average incomes (to justify the expense of the item), and have a High School or above level of education(to obtain a job that pays enough money). Considering that Apple has locations found worldwide, the geographic target demographic is likely a worldwide audience.</p>
                <h3>How did the website meet the Needs of the Visitor?</h3>
                    <p>This website epidemizes the concepts described in the article "Less is More." <br>
                    <br>One of the elements that is most emphasized is the use of "whitespace." There are many locations on the website, such as where the new iPhones are all lined up against a white background, that use this concept of whitespace. This allows the user of the website to see all the emphasized details of the phone, including its shape and color.<br>
                    <br>The concept of alignment is also prevalent this website. One of the best examples of this is in the page where the new iMac is being advertised. The smaller and larger iMac models are lined up at such an angle that the upper edges of the screens line up to create a linear shape, emphasizing the true scale of the new larger screens<br>
                    <br>The concept of hierarchy is shown in the navigation section. The most important and popular products are emphasized first, followed by the less popular items and finally followed by the about pages.
                    </p>
                <h3>How was the Content Organized to Facilitate it Being Found?</h3>
                    <p>The content was organized according to hierarchy, meaning that it was organized to funnel customers in certain directions. For instance, upon on clicking on the Mac tab at the top of the screen, it sends me straight to a page about the latest MacBook, instead of the older MacBook Air
                <h3>What did the Site do to make the mobile experience enjoyable (or at least not painful)?</h3>
                    <p>One of the factors that made this site considerably less painful to use as a mobile user was that lack of any kind of pop up when scrolling down or over text. Many websites have popups when scrolling down on or over words, which leads to tons of slowdown on mobile devices. I also noticed that the images themselves were optimized to display correctly on a mobile device. Often, websites seem to forget that mobile screens are pretty small, and that huge images really hinder from the overall experience by causing confusion and slowdown.
                <h3>Did the Site Seem to Facilitate people in a Mobile Environment? </h3>
                    <p>Absolutely, this website used many techniques to tailor it for mobile use. One of my favorite examples of this is the drop down menu near the top of the page. While it may seem silly, the fact that the website used a button that was made for mobile browsers. May times, websites use tiny buttons that are almost impossible to click when using a tiny touch screen.

            <h3>Did They or did They Not Know who Their Target Audience is?</h3>
                <p>I feel that they did know who their audience generally is, as this game is not available on mobile devices, and only on Personal Computers. However, they could have used more optimized graphics to make the site more navigable for mobile users.
            <h3>Did or Did They not Meet the Needs of Their Target Audience?</h3>
                <p> I believe they met the needs of their target audience. As I stated earlier, the intended audience are not mobile users, and as far as advertising the game goes and making it look appealing, I believe they succeeded.
            <h3>Did They or did They Not Organize Content to Facilitate it Being Found?</h3>
                <p>The content is organized nicely, and the pages present information that is pleasent loooking and easy to find on a desktop where the target audience is. However,when accessing the website on a mobile device, the text and buttons are ridiculously small,requiring extnsive zooming and some rather precise taps to select content.</p>
