            <h2>So You Want to Play Guitar?</h2>
                <p>Awesome! Here are some of the tools you need to start playing</p>
                <h3>Tools to Start</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A guitar (electric or acosutic will work)</li>
                        <li>Picks (Any Thickness will do, but between .6 mm and 1mm is recommended)</li>
                        <li>A sturdy chair (please, save yourself the trouble and try to find one that  doesn't have arms)</li>
                        <li>A tuner. While a dedicated tuner would be optimal, there are a number of mobile phone apps that, while not perfect, work admirably.  </li>
                        <li>(Optional) a capo. This will be particlalrly useful if you would like to sing along as you play guita. We'll go into more detail later.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Posture</h3>
                <p>Ok, now while this may sound stupid, there's a decent amount of reasoning behind this.</p>
